SpeedyArchiver
==============

Speedy archiver helps you transfer contents of a single archive job between environments by downloading and uploading zip files.
This is useful in situations where providers cannot not be setup between 2 instances.

Speedy works across 10g and 11g.

You must be logged in as an admin to see the additional "Speedy Archiver" menu.
